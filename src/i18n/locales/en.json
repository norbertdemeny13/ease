  "gift_cards_terms_body": "În vigoare: 20 decembrie 2022\n\n1. GENERAL\nAcești Termeni și condiţii ale Cardurilor Cadou Ease (acest „ Acord”) se aplică la achiziţionarea și utilizarea cardurilor cadou Ease (indiferent dacă sunt emise în format electronic, plastic sau alt format) („Card” și colectiv, „Carduri”) și valorii aferente acestora. Prezentul Acord este încheiat între dvs., deţinătorul cardului și Ease App SRL („Emitent”). Achiziţionând, acceptând sau folosind un Card, sunteţi de acord să fiţi obligaţi prin prezentul acord. Dacă nu sunteţi de acord cu prezentul acord, nu achiziţionaţi, utilizaţi și nu acceptaţi niciun Card. Cumpărarea și utilizarea cardurilor și a valorii aferente acestora sunt, de asemenea, supuse Termenilor și condiţiilor generale ale Ease App SRL. („Ease”), care pot fi modificate și sunt disponibile la https://www.ease.ro/Termeni-si-Conditii. Informaţiile personale colectate în legătură cu achiziţionarea sau utilizarea cardurilor sunt reglementate de Politica de confidenţialitate Ease, care poate fi modificată și este disponibilă la https://www.ease.ro/Politica-de-Confidentialitate. În caz de conflict între acest Acord și Termenii și condiţiile generale Ease, termenii și condiţiile prezentului Acord se vor aplica prioritar cu privire la orice problemă care implică Carduri. \n\n2. DESPRE CARDUL DVS \nCardurile sunt emise de emitent. Emitentul este responsabil pentru operarea și întreţinerea programului de Card. Emitentul este unicul debitor legal al deţinătorului cardului; cu specificaţia, că Emitentul își poate transfera obligaţiile în ceea ce privește Cardul în orice moment, caz în care acest beneficiar al transferului va deveni Emitentul și unicul debitor legal al Deţinătorului Cardului. Filialele și entităţile aferente ale Emitentului (inclusiv și fără limitare Ease) nu poartă nicio responsabilitate sau răspundere pentru carduri și prin aceasta, eliberaţi cu bună știinţă afiliaţii Emitentului și entităţile conexe (inclusiv și fără limitare Ease) de orice răspundere sau pretenţii de orice natură care apar în legătură cu Cardul. Cardurile pot fi achiziţionate online la https://ease.ro/carduri-cadou sau de la distribuitori terţi autorizaţi.\n \n3. CARDURILE NU SUNT DESTINATE UTILIZĂRII PROMOŢIONALE \nCardurile pot fi transferate ca și cadouri personale sau de afaceri dar nu pot fi utilizate în legătură cu activităţi de marketing, publicitate sau alte activităţi promoţionale (inclusiv și fără limitare prin intermediul site-urilor web, reclame pe Internet, e-mail, telemarketing, poștă directă, reclame în ziare și reviste, radio și emisiuni de televiziune sau premii și concursuri) cu excepţia cazului în care obţineţi aprobarea scrisă prealabilă a Emitentului. Această aprobare poate fi condiţionată, printre altele, de executarea și respectarea acordului standard de licenţă al cardului emitentului.  \n\n4. CARDURILE NU SUNT DESTINATE REV NZĂRII\nCardurile sunt valabile numai dacă sunt achiziţionate online la https://ease.ro/carduri-cadou sau de la distribuitori terţi autorizaţi. Cardurile nu sunt valabile și nu vor fi onorate dacă sunt obţinute de la vânzători sau revânzători neautorizaţi, inclusiv prin intermediul site-urilor de licitaţii de pe Internet.  \n \n5. CUMPĂRARE ȘI RĂSCUMPĂRARE\nAchiziţionând un card, acceptaţi că utilizarea dvs. a acestor carduri va respecta prezentul acord și toate legile, regulile și reglementările aplicabile. Deși nu este necesar un cont de utilizator Ease („Cont”) pentru a achiziţiona un Card, deţinătorul cardului trebuie să se înregistreze cu un Cont pentru a răscumpăra cardul. Dacă achiziţionaţi un card pe care doriţi să-l utilizaţi ca și cadou, destinatarul pe care îl desemnaţi poate fi notificat de aceasta prin e-mail la adresa de e-mail pe care o furnizaţi în timpul achiziţiei. Cardurile sunt exprimate în LEI și pot fi răscumpărate numai pentru serviciile profesionale rezervate prin aplicaţiile mobile Ease sau site-ul Ease.ro. Valoarea în LEI a Cardurilor Cadou Ease poate fi răscumpărată pentru achiziţiile de servicii profesionale prin Ease pe baza preţurilor actuale ale acestor servicii. De asemenea, deţinătorii de Carduri pot combina valoarea în LEI a Cardurilor Cadou Ease cu plăţi bănești pentru a achiziţiona servicii profesionale prin intermediul Ease. Dacă combinaţi valoarea în LEI a Cardurilor Cadou Ease cu plăţi bănești pentru a cumpăra un serviciu profesional, porţiunea din preţul serviciului care nu este acoperită de valoarea în LEI a Cardului Cadou Ease trebuie plătită cu un card de credit sau cu o altă metodă de plată acceptată de Ease. Suma în LEI percepută pentru o astfel de diferenţă va fi calculată în mod proporţional conform preţurilor afișate de Ease la momentul rezervării serviciului, în locaţia în care serviciul este programat să fie prestat. După ce Cardul dvs. este conectat la un Cont de utilizator Ease, valoarea în LEI a Cardurilor Cadou Ease nu poate fi răscumpărată prin alt Cont sau transferată altfel. Valoarea în LEI a Cardurilor Cadou Ease este rambursabilă numai pentru serviciile profesionale programate prin Ease, nu au nicio valoare monetară și nu pot fi răscumpărate în niciun caz în numerar (cu excepţia cerinţelor legale), sau pentru alte Carduri.\n\n6. EXPIRARE ȘI DEZACTIVARE \nCARDURILE ȘI VALOAREA ÎN LEI A CARDURILOR NU EXPIRĂ. Emitentul își rezervă dreptul de a dezactiva sau de a refuza onorarea oricăror Carduri (sau a oricărei valori în LEI a Cardurilor) în cazul în care metoda de plată folosită de dvs este refuzată de banca emitentă. Emitentul își rezervă, de asemenea, dreptul de a dezactiva sau de a refuza onorarea oricăror Carduri (sau a oricărei valori în LEI a Cardurilor) dacă Emitentul suspectează că respectivul Card a fost obţinut sau utilizat în mod fraudulos sau cu încălcarea prezentului Acord.\n  \n7. CARDURILE NU SE RAMBURSEAZĂ\nCu excepţia cazului în care prevede legea, nu sunt permise rambursări pentru achiziţiile de Carduri.\n\n8. CARDURI PIERDUTE FURATE SAU DETERIORATE\nCardurile pierdute, furate sau deteriorate nu vor fi înlocuite. Riscul pierderii Carduri trece către cumpărător la transmiterea electronică a Cardului către cumpărător sau destinatarul cadoului desemnat sau livrarea de către transportator, oricare dintre aceste situaţii este prima și/sau aplicabilă.  \n\n9. SOLDUL CARDULUI\nPentru întrebări despre soldul Cardului, scrieţi la support@ease.ro. Soldul pe care îl primiţi când întrebaţi la telefon sau online este doar o estimare. În cele mai multe cazuri, soldul este ajustat imediat atunci când răscumpăraţi orice valoare în LEI a Cardului pentru rezervări de servicii profesionale, dar pot exista ocazii când ajustarea soldului este întârziată.    \n\n10. CARDURI UTILIZATE FĂRĂ AUTORIZAŢIE \nCardurile care au fost utilizate fără autorizaţia titularului cardului nu vor fi înlocuite.  \n\n11. LEGISLAŢIE APLICABILĂ \nLegile române vor guverna prezentul Acord și utilizarea Cardului dumneavoastră.\n\n12. MODIFICĂRI ALE ACORDULUI\nEmitentul își rezervă dreptul de a modifica acest Acord oricând, la discreţia sa, modificări pe care vi le putem transmite prin orice mijloace rezonabile, inclusiv și fără limitare, prin publicarea versiunii revizuite a prezentului Acord la https://www.ease.ro/carduricadou.  \n\nDacă aveţi întrebări cu privire la Cardurile Cadou Ease sau la acest Acord, vă rugăm să ne contactaţi la support@ease.ro.",

Prezentul Acord este în vigoare de la data și ora la care îl acceptaţi.\n\n1. RELAŢIA CU EASE\n \n1.1. Părţile contractante\nRelaţia dintre părţi este doar ca întreprinderi independente de afaceri, fiecare dintre acestea operează o întreprindere de afaceri separată și distinctă care oferă un serviciu în afara desfășurării obișnuite a activităţii celuilalt. Acesta nu este un contract de muncă și nu sunteţi angajat. Confirmaţi existenţa și natura relaţiei contractuale de fiecare dată când accesaţi Platforma noastră. Nu vă angajăm pentru a furniza niciun serviciu; ne angajaţi pentru a vă oferi acces la Platforma noastră. Nimic din prezentul acord nu creează, sau este destinat să creeze niciun loc de muncă, parteneriat, joint venture, relaţie de franciză sau reprezentare de vânzări între dvs. și noi. Nu aveţi autoritatea de a face reprezentări în numele nostru.\n \n1.2. Alegerea dvs. de a oferi servicii profesionale consumatorilor de servicii\nAveţi opţiunea de a furniza servicii profesionale persoanelor care rezervă servicii profesionale prin aplicaţia și site-ul Ease, aceștia fiind beneficiarii prestării serviciilor oferite de dvs. la locaţia și ora aleasă de aceștia („Consumatori de servicii”). Nu dorim și nu avem dreptul de a vă direcţiona sau controla. Sub rezerva disponibilităţii platformei, dvs. decideţi când, unde și dacă (a) doriţi să oferiţi servicii profesionale pe platforma noastră și (b) dacă doriţi să acceptaţi, refuzaţi, ignoraţi sau anulaţi o ofertă sau solicitare de servicii (definită mai jos); cu condiţia că, în fiecare caz, sunteţi de acord să nu discriminaţi niciun potenţial consumator de servicii.

Prin prezenta, autorizaţi și ne instruiţi să furnizăm copii ale acestor verificări companiilor de asigurări, autorităţilor de reglementare relevante și/sau altor autorităţi guvernamentale, în cazurile prevăzute de lege. \n\n2.6. Acceptarea ofertelor/solicitărilor de servicii\n(a) Ofertele/solicitările de servicii pot apărea în Aplicaţia Elite și dvs. puteţi să le acceptaţi, refuzaţi sau ignoraţi. Acceptarea unei oferte/solicitări de servicii creează o relaţie directă de afaceri între dvs. și consumatorul de servicii, în conformitate cu opţiunile serviciului profesional pe care consumatorul le-a selectat prin intermediul Platformei noastre. Mecanismul de acceptare sau de refuzare a ofertelor/solicitărilor de servicii poate varia în funcţie de locaţia dvs. și de tipul de ofertă/solicitare de servicii acceptată.\n \n(b) Puteţi primi informaţii despre consumatorul de servicii, inclusiv locaţia acestuia, și sunteţi de acord cu faptul că și consumatorului de servicii i se pot oferi informaţii de identificare despre dvs., inclusiv prenumele, fotografia, locaţia, informaţiile despre serviciile prestate și alte informaţii pe care le-aţi furnizat voluntar în aplicaţia Elite (colectiv, „Informaţii despre clienţi”).               \n\nVă obligaţi și sunteţi de acord să nu contactaţi niciun consumator de servicii sau să folosiţi în niciun fel informaţiile consumatorului de servicii, pentru altceva decât onorarea ofertelor/solicitărilor de servicii acceptate prin Platforma noastră. Sunteţi de acord să trataţi toate informaţiile despre consumatorii serviciilor ca informaţii confidenţiale (definite mai jos) primite de dvs. în cadrul prezentului Acord. Recunoașteţi că încălcarea obligaţiilor dvs. de confidenţialitate poate încălca, de asemenea, anumite legi și ar putea duce la sancţiuni civile sau penale.\n\n2.7.

Ease vă acordă o licenţă limitată de a utiliza, de a purta sau de a afișa materiale cu logo-ul Ease pe care le-aţi primit sau cumpărat direct de la Ease („Materiale autorizate cu marca Ease”) atunci când furnizaţi servicii profesionale, doar în scopul de a vă identifica către consumatorii de servicii, ca fiind prestatorul serviciilor profesionale facilitate prin Platforma noastră.

Nu folosim aceste informaţii pentru a încerca să vă supraveghem, să vă direcţionăm sau să vă controlăm furnizarea serviciilor dvs.               \n \n(b) Sunteţi de acord că vă putem contacta prin e-mail, telefon sau mesaje SMS (inclusiv printr-un sistem automat de apelare telefonică) la oricare dintre numerele de telefon furnizate de dvs pe cont. De asemenea, înţelegeţi că puteţi renunţa la primirea mesajelor text de la noi în orice moment, fie răspunzând „STOP ” sau trimitând textul „ STOP ” la 32412 folosind dispozitivul mobil care primește mesajele, fie contactându-ne la suport@ease.ro. În pofida celor de mai sus, vă putem contacta, de asemenea, prin oricare dintre mijloacele de mai sus, inclusiv prin SMS, în cazul unei suspiciuni de fraudă sau activitate ilegală din partea dvs. sau din contul dvs.\n\n2.10. Asigurare\nClientul este de acord să încheie și să menţină pe durata acestui Acord o poliţă de asigurare de răspundere civilă profesională (malpraxis) care oferă protecţie împotriva prejudiciilor provocate accidental, la niveluri de acoperire care îndeplinesc toate condiţiile legale aplicabile pe teritoriul in care presteză servicii profesionale.\n\n \n3. PREţUL ȘI PLATA SERVICIILOR. COMISIONUL DE UTILIZARE A PLATFORMEI. POLITICĂ DE ANULARE\n\n3.1. Preţul serviciilor\nTaxa care urmează sa fie încasată de dvs. pentru serviciul prestat consumatorilor de servicii este afișată in aplicaţia Elite pentru fiecare Oferta/solicitare de servicii in parte („Preţul serviciului”, colectiv „Preţurile serviciilor”). Preţurile serviciilor variază in funcţie de categoria, tipul și durata serviciului profesional din Oferta/solicitarea de servicii, precum și de locaţia (orasul) si de ora prestării lor. Preţurile serviciilor pot fi modificate în orice moment, dar modificările nu vor afecta nicio Oferta/solicitare de servicii pe care aţi acceptat-o deja.  \n \n3.2. Modalitatea și termenul de plată a serviciilor\nEase încasează taxele pentru serviciile profesionale la momentul confirmării dvs. a rezervării efectuate de consumatorul de servicii (adică atunci când dvs. acceptaţi o Ofertă/cerere de servicii) și va iniţia plata Prețului serviciilor (mai puţin comisionul de utilizare a platformei și alte taxe, cum ar fi TVA) către contul dvs. bancar în termen de 48 de ore de la prestarea serviciilor profesionale (cu excepţia cazului în care se solicită o rambursare sau anulare din partea consumatorului de servicii). Nu putem să asigurăm că toate plăţile sunt efectuate instantaneu. Viteza cu care veţi primi plăţile va depinde de banca dvs. și de alţi factori. Durata de operare a transferului poate depinde și de metoda de plată aleasă de dvs. Unele metode implică utilizarea unor procesoare de plăţi terţe, care își pot impune propriile taxe suplimentare pentru utilizarea serviciilor lor de către dvs., care pot fi deduse direct din suma care vă este plătită.\nPrin acest Acord, dvs. numiţi pe Ease ca unic agent de colectare a plăţilor pentru serviciile profesionale prestate de dvs. prin platforma noastră, doar în scopul acceptării în numele dvs. a Taxelor de tratament pentru serviciile profesionale cumpărate de consumatorii de servicii.\nSunteţi de acord că plata efectuată de un consumator de servicii prin intermediul Ease, va fi considerată la fel ca și o plată efectuată direct către dvs. și acceptaţi să prestaţi consumatorului de servicii toate serviciile profesionale, în modul convenit, ca și cum dvs. aţi fi primit plata direct. \n3.3. Comisionul de utilizare a platformei\nPentru utilizarea platformei/marketplace-ului nostru, Ease percepe un comision de utilizare a platformei în valoare de 19% din Taxa de tratament plătită de consumatorul de servicii, incluzând TVA si alte taxe de procesare. Comisionul de utilizare a platformei este dedus automat pentru fiecare Ofertă/solicitare de servicii în parte. Preţul serviciului afișat pentru fiecare Ofertă/solicitare de servicii in aplicaţia Elite reprezintă suma totală de bani care va fi transferata în contul dvs. bancar dupa prestarea serviciului respectiv, din care a fost deja dedus comisionul de utilizare a platformei și taxele aferente.  \n\n3.4. Politică de anulare \n(a) Clientul recunoaște și este de acord că utilizatorii consumatori de servicii pot alege să anuleze sau să modifice ofertele/solicitările de servicii înainte sau după ce au fost confirmate de dvs. În cazul în care consumatorul de servicii anulează tardiv o ofertă/solicitare de servicii confirmată de dvs., Ease poate percepe o taxa de anulare în numele dvs. Deasemenea, daca consumatorul de servicii modifică tardiv ora sau locaţia unei oferte/solicitări de servicii confirmată de dvs., Ease poate percepe o taxa de modificare în numele dvs. Dacă consumatorul de servicii este taxat, această taxă de anulare sau modificare este considerată compensaţia pentru timpul dvs. fiind transferată pe contul dvs. de client. \n\n(b) Dacă dvs., în calitate de profesionist independent, anulaţi o ofertă/solicitare de servicii confirmată de dvs., sunteţi de acord că se vor aplica taxe de anulare și consecinţe pentru contul dvs. de client, inclusiv (i) publicarea unei recenzii automate pe profilul dvs. de profesionist independent, care indică faptul că aţi anulat o rezervare, (ii) impunerea unei taxe de anulare, care se reţine automat din contul dvs. de client sau in cazul in care contul dvs. nu are fonduri suficiente, rămâne ca și debit pe cont. Vi se vor anunţa situaţiile în care se aplică o taxă de anulare înainte de a decide dacă anulaţi. Dacă sunteţi taxat, această taxă de anulare este transferată consumatorului de servicii relevant sub forma unui discount la următoarea lui rezervare, pentru al recompensa pentru inconvenienţele anulării. Puteţi fi scutit de taxele de anulare la discreţia noastră absolută, din motive autentice care nu au fost sub controlul dvs. Pentru a evita o sancţiune, trebuie să contactaţi Ease pentru a vă explica și proba circumstanţele.\n\n3.5. Impozite \nClientul recunoaște și este de acord că este obligat să realizeze toate înregistrările fiscale prevăzute de lege, să calculeze și să remită toate obligaţiile fiscale aferente furnizării de servicii conform cerinţelor legii aplicabile. Clientul recunoaște și este de acord că este unicul responsabili pentru impozitele pe veniturile proprii care decurg din serviciile prestate. \n\n4. TERMENUL ȘI ÎNCETAREA ACORDULUI\n \n4.1.

Ease App SRL is a private company registered in Romania with registration number J12 / 1077/2014 whose registered office is located at the following address: Haller Karoly, 21, Cluj-Napoca, 400497, Romania . Ease App's VAT registration number is RO 32959261.\n\n1. USE OF OUR SITE AND APP\n\nOur Terms govern your use of our website (“Our Site”) and also our App (“Our App”) and the Services. By using Our Site, Our App or the Services, you agree to comply with Our Terms.\nPlease read Our Terms carefully and thoroughly. If you do not accept Our Terms, you must not make a booking through Ease for any Professional Service or purchase any Products through Ease.\n\n1.2 PERSONAL DATA\nIn order to provide the Services, we may collect personal data from you. Before making a booking or purchase through us, please read our privacy policy available here (Privacy Policy).\n\n1.3 ELIGIBLE USE\nYou confirm that you are of legal age to access and use Our Site, Our App and/or the Services and are of legal capacity to agree to Our Terms. You are not eligible to use the Services if you are under the age of 18. Our Terms apply to individuals only; for any corporate bookings or purchases, please contact us at support@ease.ro or on 0034996223.\n\n2. OUR SERVICES\n\nEase provides a booking and purchase service (the Services). The Services allow you to book a range of Professional services (Professional Services) that are performed in each and every case by independent self-employed professionals (Independent Professionals) operating as independent private persons (PFI) or authorized private person (PFA), and to purchase related goods (“Products”) that are provided by Ease or other independent retailers (“Retailers”). \n\nIn providing the Services, Ease acts as the agent of the Independent professionals and/or Retailers. Ease has no responsibility for any Professional Services or Products (excepting products branded with the Ease logo) which you book or purchase through us: we are simply involved with the booking and/or purchase process.\n\nThe Services we offer allow you to search through Our App and Our Site and purchase Professional Services and/or Products from a number of Independent professionals and/or Retailers. In enabling you to purchase Professional Services and/or Products through Our App and Our Site, we are acting as the commercial agent of those Independent professionals and/or Retailers. As part of the Services, we also provide some auxiliary services such as assisting with customer service issues (again in our capacity as agent for the Independent professionals and/or Retailers, or as a seller for the products branded with the Ease logo).\n\nHowever, as stated above, the contract for the purchase of the Professional Services and/or the Products is between you and the Independent professional and/or the Retailer (excepting products branded with the Ease logo). This means that it is the Independent professional or Retailer (not us) who is legally responsible for providing the Professional Service and/or Product to you, excepting the products branded with the Ease logo (Ease products), in which case the contract is between you and Ease. However, Ease remains responsible in respect of its obligations to you in accordance with Our Terms which shall be legally binding. If you have any questions, complaints or requests for refunds, we can be contacted directly at support@ease.ro or on 0034996223. Ease will remain the point of contact for you for customer service questions.\n\n3. AGREEMENTS FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OR PRODUCTS\n\n3.1 PROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nWhen booked through us, the Professional Service you receive will be subject to the Independent professional's terms and conditions (Independent professional's Terms). You will be provided with and asked to confirm your acceptance of the Independent professional's Terms when making a booking through us. Ease is not a party to the Independent professional's Terms: these terms will solely be between you and the Independent professional who provides you with your Professional Service.\n\n3.2 PRODUCTS\nWhen you purchase any Product (excepting Ease products) through us, you will buy directly from the relevant Retailer (not from us) and the contractual relationship in relation to the sale will be only between you and that Retailer. We will not be a party to it. The relevant Retailer will be responsible for the sale, delivery and other after-sale care and our role is limited to acting as commercial agent to conclude the sale by accepting your order and collecting, or arranging for the collection of, your payment on behalf of that Retailer.\n\nOur receipt of full payment from you will discharge your debt to the relevant Retailer in respect of that order. Though we may assist with certain practical issues on behalf of the relevant Retailer, we do not have any contractual obligations to you and you do not have any contractual rights against us regarding any Product sold through us by any Retailer.\n\nWhen you purchase any Ease Products through us, the contractual relationship in relation to the sale is between you and Ease. In this case we are responsible for the sale, delivery and other after-sale care, as described in Our Terms.\n\n4. BOOKING AND PURCHASE PROCESS\n\n4.1 BOOKING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nYou can make a booking through Our App and we will assign you an Independent professional, according to the criterias you selected.\n\nYou may only make a booking up 30 days in advance.\n\nYour payment details will be requested at the time of booking and payment will be collected when you make a booking.\n\nFull payment of the Treatment Fee is due at the moment the Independent professional confirms your professional service through us. Full details of the prices are referred to below.\n\nThe Treatment Fee belongs to the Independent professional who provides the Professional Service. Ease, as the Independent professional's agent, collects or arranges for a third party to collect on our behalf, the Treatment Fee from you. Our receipt of the full Treatment Fee will discharge your debt to the relevant Therapist in respect of that booking.\n\nWe are appointed by Independent professionals to conclude bookings on their behalf as their commercial agent. Once your booking is accepted by us on behalf of the Independent professional, you will receive confirmation of your appointment from us in App and by email.\n\nBy making a booking, you are responsible for:\n\n               •   Full payment of the applicable Treatment Fee;\n               •   Ensuring the Independent professional has access to your Designated Premises which must, in all cases, represent a suitable space in which the Professional Service can be performed, with all appropriate facilities (including adequate lighting and heating); and\n               •   Ensuring the health and safety of the Independent professional whilst at your Designated Premises.\n\n4.2 PURCHASING PRODUCTS\nProducts may be ordered by clicking on the items you wish to purchase and then following the prompts that will appear on-screen. You may also order Products through an Independent professional, who shall initiate the order on your behalf and you will receive an email prompting you to finalise the order. You may check and correct any input errors in your order up until the point at which you submit your order. You must agree to any Retailer terms presented to you before you will be able to proceed. The order is submitted by clicking the [“Buy Now”] button on the checkout page.\n\nAfter placing an order, you will receive an acknowledgment email that your order has been received and giving you an order reference number. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us or the relevant Retailer to buy the Product(s) ordered. All orders are subject to acceptance by Ease or the relevant Retailer. Ease or the Retailer is not obliged to accept your order and may, at their discretion, decline to accept any order. You do, however, acknowledge that by clicking on the [“Buy Now”] button, you enter into an obligation to pay for the Product(s). Where your order is accepted, such acceptance will be confirmed by sending you an email confirmation that your order has been despatched or, if you opt (where available) to collect, when it will be ready for collection (“Order Confirmation”). You will receive an Order Confirmation in respect of us or each Retailer from whom you are making a purchase. The agreement between you and us or the relevant Retailer in relation to the Product(s) ordered (“Retailer Agreement” or “Sales Agreement”) will only be formed and become binding when the Order Confirmation is sent to you. After entering into the Retailer or Sales Agreement, we or the relevant Retailer will be under a legal duty to supply you with goods that are in conformity with the Retailer or Sales Agreement.\n\nThe Retailer or Sales Agreement will relate only to the Product(s) which have been confirmed in the Order Confirmation. We or the relevant Retailer will not be obliged to supply any other Product(s) which may have been part of your order until such Product(s) have been confirmed in a separate Order Confirmation.\n\n5. DELIVERY OR COLLECTION OF PRODUCTS\nYour order will be fulfilled by the delivery date set out in the Order Confirmation or, if no delivery date is specified, then within 30 days after the date of the Order Confirmation, unless there are exceptional circumstances.\n\nYour order will be delivered to the delivery address within Romania, that you specify when placing your order, unless you opt (where available) to collect it from one of the collection points offered by the relevant Retailer. Your Order Confirmation will include details of the delivery or collection.\n\nProducts comprised within the same order cannot be delivered to different addresses. Deliveries cannot be made to PO Boxes.\n\nPlease also note that you must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the Product(s) are destined. The relevant Retailer will not be liable for any breach by you of any such laws.\n\n5.1 RISKS AND OWNERSHIP\nThe Product(s) ordered will be at your risk from the time of delivery or collection (as the case may be). Ownership of the Product(s) ordered will also pass to you on delivery or collection (as the case may be), provided full payment of all sums due in respect of the Product(s), including any delivery charges, has been received.\n\n6. PAYMENT\nAll Treatment Fees and/or Product Fees are payable through Our Site, Our App or over the telephone. We collect or arrange collection of payment of Treatment Fees on behalf of the Independent professional, and of Product Fees on behalf of the Retailer or Ease. In each case, our receipt of your payment as agent for the Retailer or Independent professional discharges your debt to that Retailer or Independent professional for the amount paid.\n\nWe will do all that we reasonably can to ensure that all of the information you give us when paying for the Professional Service and/or Product(s) is secure by using an encrypted secure payment mechanism.

Prices charged will normally be verified as part of the despatch procedures so that, where a Product's correct price is less than the stated price, you will be charged the lower amount. If a Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on Our Site, Our App or our telephone booking service, the relevant Retailer will normally either contact you for instructions before despatching the Product, or your order will be rejected in which case you will be notified of such rejection.\n\nFull details of Product Prices are set out in Our Site and Our App.\n\n10. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES\nIn addition to the responsibilities noted above, it is your responsibility to provide complete and accurate information at the time of booking or purchase. Failure to provide complete and accurate information may result in a rejection of your booking request, cancellation of your booking, an inability of the booked Independent professional to provide the Professional Service as requested or an inability of the Retailer to provide the Product. Such failure may also result in loss or incorrect delivery of your booking confirmation or Order Confirmation.\n\n11. CANCELLATIONS AND REFUNDS\n\n11.1 PROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nYou acknowledge that you do not have any legal right to cancel or modify a booking made for a Professional Service. However, you have a contractual entitlement to cancel or modify any booking you have made with an Independent professional through us in the following circumstances and on the described terms.\n\nSubject to the cancellation being a Late or Very Late Cancellation (as described below), if you change your mind about your booking prior to the agreed appointment start time in that booking (“Appointment Time”) then the Independent professional will be willing to treat your booking as cancelled (without requiring payment of all or any part of the applicable Treatment Fee and without levying any cancellation fee) if you cancel your booking via Our App at least four (4) hours prior to the Appointment Time.\n\nIf you want to cancel a booking with less than four (4) hours prior the Appointment Time is considered a Late Cancellation and we have the right to charge a cancellation fee which applies as follows:\n\n               •   If you request cancellation of a booking with less than four (4) hours, to a maximum of two (2) hours prior the Appointment Time, we will be entitled to retain (or charge, as the case may be) twenty percent (20%) of the applicable Treatment Fee; \n               •   If you request cancellation of a booking with less than two (2) hours, to a maximum of one (1) hour prior the Appointment Time, we will be entitled to retain (or charge, as the case may be) fifty percent (50%) of the applicable treatment fee;\n\nHowever, if you want to cancel a booking with less than one (1) hour prior the Appointment Time, the Independent professional will be entitled to retain (or charge, as the case may be) one hundred per cent (100%) of the applicable Treatment Fee because your cancellation represents a Very Late Cancellation.\n\nYou will also be charged the full Treatment Fee if you:\n\n               •   Cancel a booking other than as permitted above;\n               •   Attempt to cancel a booking on or after the Appointment Time; or\n               •   Fail to attend a booking at the Appointment Time and/or at the Designated Premises.\n\nYou also have the right to modify any booking you have made with an independent professional through us in the following circumstances and subject to the following terms and conditions:\n\nIf you want to modify the Appointment Time or the Designated place of your booking prior the Appointment Time, then where Independent professional is available to adjust his schedule according to your modification request, he will modify your reservation (without charging any modification fees) if you modify your booking via Our App at least one (4) hours prior to the Appointment Time.\n\nHowever, if you want to modify a booking with less than one (4) hours prior to the Appointment Time, is considered a Late Modification and we will be entitled to retain (or charge, as the case may be) a twenty percent (20%) booking modification fee of the applicable treatment fee;\n\nA cancellation or modification fee is charged in order to compensate the Independent professional because it is not reasonable to expect the Independent professional to be able to provide a Professional Service at another booking where you cancel with short or no notice.\n\nCancellation fees may in our absolute discretion be waived where you have been unable to cancel a booking without incurring the cancellation fee for genuine reasons which were outside of your control. Where cancellation fees are waived by us, we act as agent of the Independent professional who is the principal in supplying the Professional Service.\n\n11.2 PRODUCTS\nExcept in relation to certain Products set out below, you may cancel an order for a Product at any time before your order is delivered and up to 14 days afterwards, beginning on the day after your order (in its entirety) is delivered to you or, if you opt (where available) to collect it from one of the collection points offered by the courier and that collection point is managed by a third party other than the courier (for example, a local convenience store), the day after it is delivered to that third party (“Cooling-off Period”).\n\nIf you cancel, you will receive a full refund of the price paid for the Product(s) in accordance with the refunds policy (see below).\n\nTo cancel an order, you must clearly inform the relevant Retailer, preferably:\n\n               •   in writing, by email or telephone, giving your name, address and order reference; or\n               •   by completing and submitting our cancellation form available on Our Site or Our App, a copy of which is also enclosed with the Product(s) on delivery.\n\nYou must also return the Product(s) within 14 days after the day you notify your cancellation, in the same condition in which you receive them (which does not interfere with your right to take any reasonable steps to examine the Product(s) and make sure they conform to your order). Products must be returned to Ease or the relevant Retailer. You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the Product(s) while in your possession. If you fail to comply with this obligation, Ease or the relevant Retailer may have a right to deduct the cost of any deterioration (due, for example, to your having used the Product(s)), up to the price of the Product(s), from the refund to which you are otherwise entitled.\n\nTo return the Product(s), you should package the parcel securely (making sure you include a note of your name and address (enclosing any returns slip, if you have been provided with one) inside the parcel) and then return it to the relevant Retailer, either by courier or by recorded delivery mail or other form of certified mail or, if the Product(s) are too bulky to return by mail, then by a suitable carrier, to the returns address stated either in the Order Confirmation or the delivery note inside the delivered parcel.\n\nYou are advised to take out enough postal/carriage insurance to cover the value of the contents. Please save your proof of posting/despatch and tracking information until your refund has been processed. You will be responsible for the cost and risk of returning the Product(s).\n\nDetails of the consumer rights described above, and an explanation of how to exercise them, are provided in the Order Confirmation. Nothing in this section affects your legal rights.\n\n11.3 REFUND POLICY\nIf you cancel an order within the Cooling-off Period, any refund due to you will be processed as soon as possible and, in any case, within 14 days after the day on which Ease or the relevant Retailer receives the Product(s) back or, if earlier, the day on which Ease or the relevant Retailer receives evidence that you have returned the Product(s) to the returns address (see above). You will be refunded the price paid in full (subject to any deduction Ease or the relevant Retailer is entitled to make due to your use of or damage to the Product(s)), including the cost of standard delivery. However, you will not be refunded your cost of returning the Product(s). If you received any promotional or other discount when you paid, any refund will only reflect the amount you actually paid.\n\nRefunds are made using the same method originally used by you to pay for your purchase, unless agreed otherwise.\n\n11.4 FAULTY PRODUCTS\nIf any Product you order is damaged or faulty when delivered to you or has developed a fault, you may have one or more legal remedies available to you, depending on when you make Ease or the relevant Retailer aware of the problem, in accordance with your legal rights. If you believe a Product was delivered damaged or faulty or has developed a fault, you should inform Ease or the relevant Retailer as soon as possible, preferably in writing, giving your name, address and order reference.\n\nPlease note that we have no control over any Retailer or the quality of any of the Products or service the Retailer provides, we do not give any commitment regarding them, and we are not able to provide, and have no responsibility or liability for providing, any compensation to you on behalf of any Retailer.\n\nNothing in this section affects your legal rights.\n\n11.5 EXTENSIONS AND DELAYS\nIf you wish to extend the time you have booked a Professional Service, the Independent professional will endeavour to fulfil your request. This is subject to the availability of the Independent professional and payment of an additional charge for the extended time calculated in accordance with the Treatment Prices (each an “Extra Time Charge” and collectively, “Extra Time Charges”).\n\nIf you are delayed and unable to start the Professional Service at the Designated Premises at the Appointment Time by more than 10 minutes then, unless the Independent professional agrees to the contrary (which is within the sole discretion of the Independent professional):\n\n               •   The Independent professional is entitled to end the Professional Service at the time agreed when the booking was made without making any adjustment to the Treatment Price to reflect the reduced time of the Professional Service; or\n               •   If you and the Independent professional agree to proceed with the Professional Service for the full time allotted notwithstanding the delayed start time, then you shall be obliged to pay before the relevant Professional Service is given, an additional charge calculated at the rate set out with the Treatment Prices for extra time.\n\nWe will collect the Extra Time Charges as agent of the Independent professional.\n\n12. EASE ACTS ONLY AS AN INTRODUCER\nThe Services enable those seeking Professional Services to book appointments with Independent professionals seeking to provide such Professional Services. Whilst Ease assesses Independent professionals who wish to provide Professional Services, we do not guarantee or warrant, and make no representations regarding the reliability, quality or suitability of Independent professionals. This is entirely a matter for you. Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that Ease does not have any obligation to conduct any background checks on any Independent professional and have no obligation in respect of any service they may provide.\n\nWhen interacting with any Independent professional you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety, details and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons who are unknown to you.\n\n13.
